PHP-REST-API

This is a repository for holding one-file-only php file, that works as an API for performing CRUD applications. I used and modified this file for a school project, where I had to perform API calls to a LAMP stack. This PHP API serves as a middleman between MySQL and frontend application.

The API is taken from: https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api
